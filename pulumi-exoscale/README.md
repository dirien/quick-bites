## Running a Minecraft Server on an Exoscale SKS Cluster using Pulumi and CUE

### Introduction

To celebrate the launch of the [Exoscale Pulumi provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/exoscale/), I decided to create a `Pulumi` program that deploys a `Minecraft` server on an [Exoscale SKS cluster](https://www.exoscale.com/sks/).

%[https://twitter.com/SebastienPittet/status/1588466439627091968?s=20&t=6f4gwZzKUwytNjq0U1UP0w]

But to give the article a little plot twist, I decided to use [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) to define the `Pulumi` program. We create a CUE module that will define the `Pulumi` program and the actuel SKS cluster implementation will be defined as a CUE package.

So we can create several SKS cluster implementations using the `CUE` package.

### Prerequisites

To follow this article, we` need to have the following tools installed:

- `CUE` CLI installed
- `Pulumi` CLI installed
- `Exoscale` CLI (optional)

And we need to have an `Exoscale` account. Head over to [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) to create an account.

### Exoscale?

`Exoscale` is a Swiss cloud provider, that offers a wide range of cloud services. It offers a wide range of cloud services like:

- Compute instances
- Kubernetes clusters
- Object storage
- Databases as a service (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Opensearch, MySql)
- DNS

It has several datacenters in Europe, which is really a nice, not only this gives us the possibility to deploy your applications in the datacenter that is closest to your users, but we can also create a high availability setup.

Following datacenters are available:

- Frankfurt (Germany)
- Munich (Germany)
- Zurich (Switzerland)
- Vienna (Austria)
- Geneva (Switzerland)
- Sofia (Bulgaria)

I am huge fan of European cloud providers, and I am happy to see that with `Exoscale` there is an alternative to the big three cloud providers.

#### Create your API key

As soon as you have created an account, you are able to create an API key. This API key will be used by `Pulumi` to create the resources.

Head over to the `https://portal.exoscale.com/u/<account>/iam/api-keys` page and create a new API key. You can give it a name, like `pulumi`, so you know what it is used for later.

And that's it, you have created your API key. Let us head over to install the `Pulumi` CLI.

### Pulumi - Modern infrastructure As Code

`Pulumi` is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool for creating, deploying and managing cloud infrastructure. `Pulumi` works with traditional infrastructures like VMs, networks, and databases and modern architectures, including containers, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions. `Pulumi` supports dozens of public, private, and hybrid cloud service providers.

#### Installing Pulumi

Before we can start to deploy our infrastructure, we need to install the [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/cli/). This can be done either on your local development machine or on your build agent. We cover the installation of the cli for some scenarios in the next section.

`Pulumi` stores metadata about your infrastructure so that it can manage your cloud resources and detected any changes betyouen two deployments. This metadata is called state.

`Pulumi` stores its state in a backend of your choosing. There are two types of backends:

- Service: a managed cloud experience using the online or self-hosted `Pulumi` Service application
- Self-Managed: There is a wide range of self-managed backends available from AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud
  Storage, any AWS S3 compatible server to even your local filesystem.

Head over to [Pulumi service](https://app.pulumi.com/) to create your free SaaS backend. No need to handle state files.

##### Installation on macOS

You can install `Pulumi` through the Homebrew package manager and using the official `Pulumi` Homebrew Tap. Open a terminal and type the following command:

```
$ brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
```

##### Installation on Windows

You can install `Pulumi` using elevated permissions through the Chocolatey package manager:

```
$ choco install pulumi
```

##### Installation on Linux

To install, run the installation script via the following command:

```
$curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```

This will install the pulumi CLI to `~/.pulumi/bin` and add it to your path. If this command fails at automatically adding pulumi to your path, you will be prompted to add it manually.

Alternatively, we can install `Pulumi` manually. `Pulumi` provided a prebuilt binary for Linux.

Head over to the [available versions](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) page to choose the version of `Pulumi` you want to install.

Extract the tarball and move the binaries in the pulumi directory to a directory included in your system’s `$PATH`.

##### Verifying your Installation

To verify that we have successfully installed `Pulumi`, run the following command:

```
$ pulumi version
v3.46.0
```

### What is CUE?

`CUE` is a logical language for working with config, schemas, data, and executing on these things.

First, we should understand that `CUE` is not a general purpose language and instead aims for Turing-incompleteness. The underlying philosophy is that it is harder for both humans and tooling to understand configuration and data that has been programmed together.

Remember: `CUE` is a superset of JSON. This means we can represent any JSON in `CUE` with a slightly different syntax and then add the `CUE` magic to it!

Example: `cars.json`:

```json
{
  "cars": [
    {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }
  ]
}
```

And the same data in `CUE`:

```cue
cars: [
  {
    brand: "Ford"
    model: "Mustang"
    year: 1964
  }
]
```

Let's think about `JSONSchema` vs `JSON`, they are separate concepts. One defines a schema, the other is data. In `CUE` they are the same. `CUE` merges types and values into a single concept, the value lattice. This gives us the ability to define schemas, refine with constraints, and create valid data in the same file. It also means defining schemas is more natural with how we think about and write code as humans.

With `CUE`, when we write code, it is not instructions for the computer. Rather, we are specifying something and `CUE` tells we if it is valid or not. If this sounds weird right now, worry not, it becomes natural pretty quickly. Under the hood, `CUE` analyzes your code with graph unification algorithms based in part on NLP techniques from the 90’s (pre deep learning). Because of this, we can spread configuration across directories and packages, pulling common schema, constraint, logic, and values into reusable modules.

There is a good YouTube videos about `CUE` made from `Matty` and `Alison Dowdney ` you can go check out:

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttcm5HtXTKs]

##### Installing CUE

The `CUE` command line tool is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows. You can check on the [official installation page](https://cuelang.org/docs/install/) for detailed instructions depending on your OS.

As I am using `macOS` and `Homebrew`, I will use the following command to install `CUE`:

```bash
brew install cue-lang/tap/cue
```

Verify that the installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
cue version
```

And we should see the following output:

```bash
cue version 0.4.3 darwin/amd64
```

And that's it, we have installed `CUE` and are ready to start using it.

### Create your Pulumi project

`Pulumi` is a multi-language infrastructure as code tool using imperative languages to create a declarative infrastructure description.

You have a wide range of programming languages available, and you can use the one you and your team are the most comfortable with. Currently, (11/2022) `Pulumi` supports the following languages:

- Node.js (JavaScript / TypeScript)
- Python
- Go
- Java
- .NET (C#, VB, F#)
- YAML

As we want to use `CUE` we will use YAML.

Create a project folder (for example `pulumi-exoscale`) and navigate into the newly created directory:

```bash
mkdir pulumi-exoscale && cd pulumi-exoscale
```

Create a new `Pulumi` program with the following command:

```bash
pulumi new yaml

This command will walk you through creating a new Pulumi project.

Enter a value or leave blank to accept the (default), and press <ENTER>.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

project name: pulumi-exoscale
project description: (A minimal YAML Pulumi program) 
Created project 'pulumi-exoscale'

Please enter your desired stack name.
To create a stack in an organization, use the format <org-name>/<stack-name> (e.g. `acmecorp/dev`).
stack name: (dev) team1
Created stack 'dev'

...

Your new project is ready to go! ✨

To perform an initial deployment, run `pulumi up`
```

As we want to use `CUE`, we need to change following line in the `Pulumi.yaml` file:

```yaml
runtime: yaml
```

to the following:

```yaml
runtime:
  name: yaml
  options:
    compiler: cue export
```

The reason behind is that `Pulumi` YAML includes native support for languages that compile to YAML/JSON via the `compiler` runtime option and `Pulumi` will run whatever program and arguments are specified in compiler and interpret the output as a `Pulumi` YAML program.

Now we can start writing our infrastructure as code.

First, we need to create our `CUE` module. Create a new folder called `cue.mod` and create a new file called `module.cue` in it.

It contains the following content, which is the basic structure of a `CUE` module:

```cue
module: "exoscale.pulumi.com/minecraft"
```

Then we can create our first package. Create a new folder called `sks` and create a new file called `sks.cue` in it.

Now we can start to create our `CUE` schemas. For this we create two `Defintions`, one for the `Minecraft` server properties and one for the `Exoscale` SKS cluster.

```cue
#MinecraftServerProperties: {
	version: *"latest" | string
	type:    *"VANILLA" | string
	motd:    *"Hello from Exoscale" | string
}
```

Here we see also the first `CUE` feature, which is the default value. We can define a default value for a field by using a `*` before the type. In this case, we define the default value for the `version` field to be `latest` and for the `type` field to be `VANILLA`. The `motd` field gets the default value `Hello from Exoscale`.

Now we can create our second definition for the `Exoscale` SKS cluster:

```cue
#ExoscaleMinecraft: {
	resourceName:              strings.MaxRunes(10) & =~"^[a-z0-9-]+$"
	sksZone:                   string
	sksVersion:                *"1.25.1" | string
	sksCNI:                    *"calico" | string
	sksNodePoolSize:           int & >=1 & <=10
	sksNodePoolInstanceType:   *"standard.medium" | string
	mcNamespace:               *"minecraft" | string
	mcChartVersion:            *"4.4.0" | string
	minecraftServerProperties: #MinecraftServerProperties

	variables: {
		"default-sec-group": {
			"fn::invoke": {
				function: "sks:index/getSecurityGroup:getSecurityGroup"
				arguments: {
					name: "default"
				}
			}
		}
	}

	resources: {
		"\(resourceName)-mc-cluster": {
			type: "sks:SKSCluster"
			properties: {
				zone:          sksZone
				name:          "\(resourceName)-mc-cluster"
				exoscaleCcm:   true
				metricsServer: true
				version:       sksVersion
				cni:           sksCNI
			}
		}

		...

		if sksCNI == "calico" {
			"\(resourceName)-calico-vxlan-security-group-rule": {
				type: "sks:SecurityGroupRule"
				properties: {
					securityGroupId:     "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
					description:         "Calico (vxlan)"
					userSecurityGroupId: "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
					type:                "INGRESS"
					protocol:            "UDP"
					startPort:           4789
					endPort:             4789
				}
			}
		}

		"\(resourceName)-minecraft-tcp-security-group-rule": {
			type: "sks:SecurityGroupRule"
			properties: {
				securityGroupId: "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
				description:     "Minecraft TCP services"
				cidr:            "0.0.0.0/0"
				type:            "INGRESS"
				protocol:        "TCP"
				startPort:       25565
				endPort:         25565
			}
		}
		
		"\(resourceName)-minecraft-chart": {
			type: "kubernetes:helm.sh/v3:Release"
			properties: {
				name:      "minecraft"
				namespace: "${\(resourceName)-minecraft-namespace}"
				chart:     "minecraft"
				version:   mcChartVersion
				repositoryOpts:
					repo: "https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/"
				values: {
					resources: {
						requests: {
							memory: "128Mi"
							cpu:    "100m"
						}
					}
					minecraftServer: {
						eula:        true
						version:     minecraftServerProperties.version
						type:        minecraftServerProperties.type
						motd:        minecraftServerProperties.motd
						serviceType: "LoadBalancer"
					}
				}
			}
			options:
				provider: "${\(resourceName)-mc-k8s-provider}"
		}
	}

	outputs: {
		"\(resourceName)-kubeconfig": {
			"fn::secret": "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-kubeconfig.kubeconfig}"
		}
	}
}
```

This is a lot of code, so let's break it down. Please note that this is not a complete `CUE` schema, we can check the full schema in the corresponding GitHub repository.

Similar to the `MinecraftServerProperties` definition, we define again different fields with default values. But this time I do also some more advanced things. First, I define a variable called `resourceName` which is a string with a max length of 10 characters and only allows lowercase letters, numbers and dashes.

```cue
resourceName: strings.MaxRunes(10) & =~"^[a-z0-9-]+$"
```

Another advanced feature is the validation of the `sksNodePoolSize` field. We can use the `&` operator to combine multiple validations. In this case, we validate that the value is an integer, greater or equal to 1 and less or equal to 10.

```cue
sksNodePoolSize: int & >=1 & <=10
```

If we ran `cue vet` with a wrong value for the `sksNodePoolSize` field, we would get the following error:

```text
❯ cue vet .
servers.0.resources."server-1-mc-nodepool".properties.size: invalid value 300 (out of bound <=10):
    ./sks/sks.cue:16:41
    ./main.cue:9:19
servers.0.sksNodePoolSize: invalid value 300 (out of bound <=10):
    ./sks/sks.cue:16:41
    ./main.cue:9:19
```

Same for the `name` field, entered a wrong value would result in the following error:

```text
cue vet .
servers.0.resourceName: invalid value "Server-1" (out of bound =~"^[a-z0-9-]+$"):
    ./sks/sks.cue:12:52
    ./main.cue:6:19
    ./sks/sks.cue:12:29
...
```

Another interesting feature is the `if` statement. We can use it to define different resources depending on the value of, in this case, the `sksCNI` field. If the value is `calico`, we define a different security group rule as if set the value to `calico`

```cue
if sksCNI == "cilium" {
    "\(resourceName)-cilium-vxlan-security-group-rule": {
        type: "sks:SecurityGroupRule"
        properties: {
            securityGroupId:     "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            description:         "Cilium (vxlan)"
            userSecurityGroupId: "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            type:                "INGRESS"
            protocol:            "UDP"
            startPort:           8472
            endPort:             8472
        }
    }
    "\(resourceName)-cilium-healthcheck-tcp-security-group-rule": {
        type: "sks:SecurityGroupRule"
        properties: {
            securityGroupId:     "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            description:         "Cilium (healthcheck)"
            userSecurityGroupId: "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            type:                "INGRESS"
            protocol:            "TCP"
            startPort:           4240
            endPort:             4240
        }
    }
}

if sksCNI == "calico" {
    "\(resourceName)-calico-vxlan-security-group-rule": {
        type: "sks:SecurityGroupRule"
        properties: {
            securityGroupId:     "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            description:         "Calico (vxlan)"
            userSecurityGroupId: "${\(resourceName)-mc-sks-security-group.id}"
            type:                "INGRESS"
            protocol:            "UDP"
            startPort:           4789
            endPort:             4789
        }
    }
}
```

Now let's take a look into some `Pulumi` YAML specific things. The `Pulumi` YAML specification follow a simple schema, including four top level sections: `resources`, `config`, `variables` and `outputs`.

The `resources` section is the most important one. It defines the resources that should be created. The minimum required fields are `type` and `properties`.

Here is an example of a resource definition:

```yaml
resources:
  my-bucket:
    type: aws:s3:Bucket
    properties:
      website:
        indexDocument: index.html
```

So in our case, as we want to maybe create more the one cluster, we need to be able to set a unique name for each `Pulumi` resource.

```cue
"\(resourceName)-mc-sks-cluster": {
    type: "sks:Cluster"
    properties: {
        name:        resourceName
        description: "Minecraft Server"
        version:     sksVersion
        
    }
}
```

So to create the unique name, the interpolation syntax of `CUE`. `"\(resourceName)-mc-sks-cluster"` is the same as `"server-1-mc-sks-cluster"` if the `resourceName` is set to `server-1`.

In the whole schema definition we will find a lot of `"\(resourceName)-..."` strings.

Now we can head over to create our main `CUE` file. In this file we import the `sks.cue` file and define the `servers`

```cue
package main

import "exoscale.pulumi.com/minecraft/sks:sks"

servers: [ sks.#ExoscaleMinecraft & {
	resourceName:    "server-1"
	sksZone:         "de-fra-1"
	sksCNI:          "cilium"
	sksNodePoolSize: 3
	minecraftServerProperties: {
		type: "paper"
	}
},
	sks.#ExoscaleMinecraft & {
		resourceName:    "server-2"
		sksZone:         "de-fra-1"
		sksCNI:          "calico"
		sksNodePoolSize: 3
		minecraftServerProperties: {
			type: "paper"
		}
	},
]

for i, server in servers {
	variables: {
		server.variables
	}

	resources: {
		server.resources
	}

	outputs: {
		server.outputs
	}
}
```

In this file we define two servers. The first one is using Cilium as CNI and the second one is using Calico. Then we iterate over the servers and add the variables, resources and outputs to the main file.

Now we can run `cue vet` to validate the schema and `pulumi up` to deploy the stack.

```bash
cue vet .
```

Should not return any errors.

Export the `Exoscale` API key and secret as environment variables and run `pulumi preview` to see preview of all the resources that will be created.

```bash
export EXOSCALE_API_KEY=...
export EXOSCALE_API_SECRET=...
pulumi preview
```

You should see something like this, if you decided to create two servers:

```bash
pulumi preview 
Previewing update (dev)

If everything looks good, run `pulumi up` to deploy the stack, the flags `-f` and `-y` can be used to YOLO the deployment without any confirmation and preview.

```bash
pulumi up -f -y
```

This could take a while, depending on the size of the node pools. Go grab a coffee or a beer, I'll wait!

Before we check if the `Minecraft` servers are up and running, let us check with the `Exoscale` CLI if the SKS cluster are up and running.

```bash
 exo compute sks list
┼──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────┼
│                  ID                  │        NAME         │   ZONE   │
┼──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────┼
│ 92de22f7-be0c-4324-aaba-ff35b072882a │ server-2-mc-cluster │ de-fra-1 │
│ f4331a42-7afc-4578-a897-98dc8b8c0669 │ server-1-mc-cluster │ de-fra-1 │
┼──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────┼
```

And let us look into the UI too, just to be sure:

Now let us check that the `Minecraft` servers are working correctly! We can run `pulumi stack output` to get the kubeconfig for each server.

```bash
pulumi stack output server-1-kubeconfig --show-secrets > exoscale-1.yaml
pulumi stack output server-2-kubeconfig --show-secrets > exoscale-2.yaml
```

Then we can use `kubectl` to check that the `Minecraft` server is running.

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig exoscale-1.yaml get pods -n minecraft
```

And we should see something like this:

```bash
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
minecraft-minecraft-b5d7587dc-s6tfx   1/1     Running   0          3m42s
```

Or be lazy and use `k9s` to check the status of the pods.

```bash
k9s --kubeconfig exoscale-1.yaml
```

### Play Minecraft

Of course, we can't play `Minecraft` without a client. You can download the client from the official website and connect to the server using the IP address of the load balancer.

```bash 
kubectl --kubeconfig exoscale-1.yaml get svc -n minecraft
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)           AGE
minecraft-minecraft   LoadBalancer   10.104.217.15   194.182.169.230   25565:30497/TCP   4m17s
```

Now we can connect to the `Minecraft` server using the IP address of the load balancer.

### Clean up

As always, don't forget to clean up after yourself. You can run `pulumi destroy` to delete the stack.

```bash
pulumi destroy -f -y
```

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have seen how to deploy a `Minecraft` server on `Exoscale` using `Pulumi`. We have also seen how to use `CUE` to generate the `Pulumi` code.
